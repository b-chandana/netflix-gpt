--> Routing

--> Formik library is good when we use forms inside a react project
--> useRef hook
--> for authentication we need back-end and we are using firebase to handle this project backend work

npm i -D react-router-dom
in the firebase
-create a new project
-npm install firebase
==> steps for deployment

1.-firebase login
2.-firebase init

3.-firebase deploy
